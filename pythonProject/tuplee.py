#Unpacking a Tuple
#When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

#Example
#Packing a tuple:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

#In Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

print(red)
print(yellow)
#print(green)

#If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:

#Example
#Assign the rest of the values as a list called "red":
print("------------ASTERISK__________(*)")
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits

#If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left.
