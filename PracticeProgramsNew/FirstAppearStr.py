#12.Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a
# given string, if 'not' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# Sample String: 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
# 'The lyrics is poor!'
# Expected Result: 'The lyrics is good!'
# 'The lyrics is poor!'
