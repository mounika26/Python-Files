#Similar to list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions are also a powerful alternative to for-loops and lambda functions. For-loops, and nested for-loops in particular, can become complicated and confusing. Dictionary comprehensions offer a more compact way of writing the same code, making it easier to read and understand.

#Class-based iterators in Python are often verbose and require a lot of overhead. Generators, on the other hand, are able to perform the same function while automatically reducing the overhead.
#Generators are relatively easy to create; a normal function is defined with a yield statement, rather than a return statement. The yield statement has the effect of pausing the function and saving its local state, so that successive calls continue from where it left off.

# g=(x**2 for x in range(10))
# print(list(g))
